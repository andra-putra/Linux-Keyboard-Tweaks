# Kali Linux Tweaks

This repository contains my configuration files and scripts for customizing Kali Linux. I started with Ubuntu dual-booting with Windows 10, but after experiencing some corruption issues, I decided to switch to Kali Linux. This decision was also influenced by my interest in penetration testing.

Unfortunately, I lost a few customizations during the switch, such as my custom login screen based around Lain's Copland OS, which I found on GitHub.

## Keyboard Bindings

Initially, I had to use different methods to achieve my desired key bindings, as each method couldn't accomplish everything I wanted. However, I have since managed to get all my custom key bindings working using an .Xmodmap file.

### Current settings:

- Caps Lock & Ctrl swap: Using .Xmodmap file
- Backspace and Backslash swap: Using .Xmodmap file
